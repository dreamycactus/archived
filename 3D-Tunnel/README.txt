Instructions:
You fly a colourful ship. Left and Right arrows to control its side to side movement.
If you hit a MONKEY HEAD you will lose some shields and some of your colour. Hit 3 times and you die.
If you hit a FACE you will add the face's colour to your own.
(Colour was planned for something more, but for now it is only for viewing pleasure only)

Features:
- Extensive use of VERTEX BUFFER OBJECTS
- OBJ Loader and MESH renderer with TEXTURES
- Custom models and textures
- Particles
- Frame independent game logic (runs same speed on all computers --should--)
- Lighting
- Use of objects pools rather than constant dynamic allocation (not for graphics, strictly, but good for performance)
- Basic collision detection
- Fully functional FPS camera (although not all of its features are used in this demo)
	- Matrix operations for calculating view & projection
