Runner Game
Made in summer of 2010.
This game is a run and jump.
You are chasing after your adopted kid who was kidnapped and on the train in the distance.
There is a bomb on the train, and if the signal is too weak (Train gets too far ahead), 
a compartment on the train will blow up. If all compartments blow up, your kid is dead.

Up is jump, down is slide.
Right is attack - shoot for guy, parry/slash for girl
Down is slide.

Avoid the enemies that are preventing you from rescuing your kid.
