Welcome to Scriptor2000 ver 1.0 Alpha.

This is a scripting engine that allows users to create their own games with relative ease. There is a documentation that is scheduled for release. Please wait till then.

To run this game, extract all the files in one location and run the .exe file. Supported platforms are Windows XP and higher.

We've put a lot of effort into this and hope you enjoy.


Update Jan 2012

It seems I have lost the original source code to this game. Only the executable now.
