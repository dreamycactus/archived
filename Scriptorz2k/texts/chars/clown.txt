Choco: Mother Goose stole the woman face, but it hasn't been returned it! Now she can't see poor Sam, or hear anything he says. I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Guess the poor boy is really lost, forever sitting in the lost and found.

You approach the woman and you feel a strange sucking sensation on your face. You close your eyes but it doesn't hurt. After a few moments you open them again. A crying but smiling woman is staring at Sam.
"I can't believe you really did that", Choco the Clown exclaims in shock. "But now... you can't walk around like that." He takes a marker from his pocket, and begins drawing on your face. When he's done, he steps back, and takes a few appreciative nods. "You'll forever be happy now, because now you have a smiley face."
"Thank you miss," Sam thanked you, "You can have what I got in the lost and found. I think it will be useful." Sam gives you a silver key.

You leave the woman, Sam and Choco behind and head back to the amusement park entrance. Santa is there waiting for you. "Have fun, kiddo?" He asks. "It was alright." You say. You go back together to the corn fields. (The game ends here for now...)

You leave the amusement park with Sam, his mum and Choco waving by the gates. Santa is waiting for you there. "I see you've made some new friends." He says. "Yeah," you reply, as the two of you head back to the corn fields. (The game ends here for now...)
