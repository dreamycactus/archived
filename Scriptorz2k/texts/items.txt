The bang of the gun transpires down the tunnel, and you hear in return the sound of a sharp shrill cry. She flapped around in a mindless craze, and pecked at anything it could reach. Her eyes grew red, and blood seeped out from her nostrils. Then just as sudden as it came, she fell, motionless in the watery floor. Her blood slowly spreads through the surface of the floor, embedding itself into crevices. As the echo of the gunshot dies you hear the sound of faint laughter from above.
